üö® CURRENT ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
- Missing follower/following counts for post creators
- Profile pictures may not load due to missing HD URLs
- Verification status not available for post owners
- Business account information missing

üîß SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
We need to enhance the scraping process to include profile data by:
1. Extracting usernames from post URLs
2. Using Instagram Profile Scraper for each unique username
3. Merging profile data with post data
4. Adding the missing fields listed above

=====================================
USAGE NOTES:
- All arrays can be empty []
- String fields may be empty ""
- Number fields default to 0 if not available
- Boolean fields are true/false
- Timestamp fields are in ISO 8601 format
- URLs are direct Instagram CDN links
- Some fields may be null or undefined depending on post type

CSV EXPORT FIELDS:
The dashboard CSV export includes all major fields above, with nested objects flattened into readable strings.

COMMENT STRUCTURE:
Comments can have nested replies, creating a hierarchical structure. Each reply has the same structure as a top-level comment.

TAGGED USERS vs CO-AUTHORS:
- taggedUsers: People tagged in the post content
- coauthorProducers: Collaborators who helped create the content
